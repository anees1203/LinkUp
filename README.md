# Linkup - Real-Time Chat Application

Linkup is a real-time chat application built to enhance communication and connectivity with friends. This project was created as a learning experience to explore various web development technologies. Through research and online resources, I successfully built and deployed this application while gaining hands-on experience with modern web technologies.

## Technologies Used
During this project, I learned and implemented the following technologies:

- **JavaScript** – Core scripting language for frontend and backend development.
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing chat data efficiently.
- **bcryptjs** – Library for hashing and securing user passwords.
- **Express** – Backend framework for building the API.
- **Mongoose** – ODM (Object Data Modeling) for MongoDB.
- **Socket.io** – Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between users.
- **Zustand** – State management for handling application data.
- **React** – Frontend library for building a dynamic UI.
- **TailwindCSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Vite** – Fast build tool and development server for React.
- **DaisyUI** – Component library for styling UI elements.
